h1. Luastow

Luastow is a Lua implementation of ["GNU Stow":https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/].

I was looking for something like GNU Stow for Windows, and only found a ["Python implementation":https://github.com/ericsubach/stow-lite]. However, since I mainly use Lua, and feel that it’s easier to just compile and link @lua.exe@ on Windows than going down the rabbit hole that is Python’s Windows distribution, I re-created GNU Stow myself, and plan to extend it with features that I find useful for me as well.

h2. Features/To-do List

* ☑ Stow a directory.
* ☑ Delete links of a stowed directory.
  Luastow doesn’t delete directories that end up empty after deleting links.
* ☑ Better error management if a file that is being linked is already present in the target directory.
* ☐ Merge @info@ files commonly used in GNU-related programs.
* ☐ Restow a directory from anywhere instead of having to navigate to the @luastow@ directory.

h2. Usage

Luastow can be executed like a Lua script. There’s an _amalgamated_ version (using ["lua-amalg":https://github.com/siffiejoe/lua-amalg]) inside @bin/@ that correctly sets up all required modules. You’ll just have to make it executable.

bc.. A portable GNU Stow implementation in Lua.

Arguments:
   source_dir            Source directory.

Options:
   -t <target>, --target <target>
                         Target directory. (default: /Users/Leye/Desktop)
   -D, --delete          Delete from luastow directory.
   -R, --restow          Restow source directory (remove from luastow directory, then stow into target directory again.
   -v, --verbose         Prints debug messages.
   -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.

p. Debug messages can be made more verbose with @-vv@.

h3. Requirements

Luastow currently needs:

* LuaFileSystem
* argparse

These packages are found in _luarocks_. I’ll add a @rockspec@ file soon.

h3. Disclaimer

Luastow was written on a free Saturday afternoon. I’ve used and tested it for me on OS X, but I’ll first want to add better error management and unit tests before I can deem it to be used safely.
